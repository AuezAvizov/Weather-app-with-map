# React Weather App with Yandex Maps

This React application provides users with up-to-date weather information by integrating **Yandex Maps** and the **Yandex Weather API**. It offers an intuitive experience for searching locations directly on the map and viewing detailed weather data for those areas in real time.

## Features

- **Interactive Yandex Maps**: Users can interact with Yandex Maps to choose any location of interest by clicking or searching for specific areas. The map seamlessly integrates with the weather feature.
- **Real-Time Weather Updates**: Upon selecting a location, the app fetches real-time weather data from the Yandex Weather API, providing detailed information such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and general weather conditions.
- **Simple & Clean UI**: The user interface is designed to be minimalistic, making it easy for users to find the information they need without distractions. The map and weather data are presented clearly for a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work well across different devices, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile screens.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how to build a practical, user-friendly weather app by leveraging third-party APIs. By integrating **Yandex Maps** and **Yandex Weather**, the app shows the possibilities of combining mapping technology with real-time data to create useful applications. It serves as a showcase of basic React development skills, focusing on API integration, state management, and UI design.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to set up the necessary dependencies.
3. Use `npm start` to run the app in development mode.
4. Interact with the map to explore weather data for various locations.

## Potential Future Enhancements
